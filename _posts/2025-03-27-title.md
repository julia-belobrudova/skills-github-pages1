What is a Data Lake?
A data lake is a place to store large amounts of data — like a big digital filing cabinet. You can put all kinds of data in it, including:

📊 Structured data (like spreadsheets or database tables)

📄 Semi-structured data (like JSON or XML files)

📷 Unstructured data (like images, videos, or documents)

The data is usually stored in files, not traditional databases.

🔍 How is it used?
When someone wants to analyze or report on the data, tools like Spark or Hadoop come in and read the files. At that moment, they organize the data into tables — but only while reading it.

This is called schema-on-read, which means:

"We don’t care what the data looks like when we store it. We only structure it when we need to read or analyze it."

✅ Why Use a Data Lake?
You can store all types of data in one place

You don’t need to organize it right away

It’s useful for data scientists, analysts, and big data projects

It works well with modern tools that handle large amounts of data

🧠 Simple Analogy:
Imagine a data warehouse is like a library with shelves labeled and books sorted perfectly.

A data lake is like a giant storage room where all the books, papers, photos, and videos are kept together — and you organize them only when you need to read or use them.
